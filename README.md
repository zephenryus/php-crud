php-crud
========

A PHP framework which offers easy access to create, read, update and delete records of a MySQL database. The purpose of this class is to create a public interface with a MySQL database which is more intuitive and PHP programming centric. Rather than submitting SQL queries to the database, associative arrays containing values are passed to the methods which are then parsed into create, read, update and delete queries.
